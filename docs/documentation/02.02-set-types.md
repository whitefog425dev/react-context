Any child below your root component can now subscribe to any of the context types by defining `contextTypes`.

Use the `context.subscribe` function as a shortcut to avoid having to define context types. Pass it an array of types you want to subscribe to, or call it with no arguments to subscribe to all of them!

```
var React = require('react');
var context = require('react-context');

var Child = React.createClass({
  render(){
    return <div>{ this.context.focus }</div>
  }
});

Child.contextTypes = context.subscribe()

module.exports = Child;
```
Otherwise, you can use `contextTypes` the traditional way and include the types you want to subscribe to:
```javascript
Child.contextTypes = {
  pointer: React.PropTypes.string,
  density: React.PropTypes.number,
  width: React.PropTypes.number,
  height: React.PropTypes.number,
  language: React.PropTypes.string,
  focus: React.PropTypes.bool,
  scroll: React.PropTypes.number,
  adBlock: React.PropTypes.bool,
  os: React.PropTypes.string,
  browser: React.PropTypes.string,
  browserVersion: React.PropTypes.string
};
```
